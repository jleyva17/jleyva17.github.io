        engines . Due to their very high affinity for sentience, 3c organisms make very efficient light waste converters. A type 3c culture running at peak efficiency can convert 100 gTz of light waste into
        150 gDk of usable dark matter. Though the high affinity for sentience makes 3c organisms very efficient it also makes them very unstable. 3c organisms must be kept at or near peak efficiency or they
        quickly become unusable converters .<br>The goal is to <br>In this experiment: you will use the various propagation techniques to manipulate awareness of a microculture of 3c organisms, collecting data on the ra
