    an ideology. Therefore it is optimal to keep messaging consistent. But on the other hand, a message must be tailored to the target audience, making consistent messaging less than ideal if you have a diverse populous.
    Luckily HERD engineers have devised a couple of ways minimize this conflict.</p>
    <p> The most ingenious of which is by pitting ideologies that oppose the target ideology against each other . In doing this,
    you can convince your opposers that it is not you who they oppose, but the other people (who also happen to oppose your ideology). We do this by exploiting the complexity of ideology and it's relationship
    to the individual. because ideology is a complex amalgamation of personal experiences , an attack on a person's core ideologies is an attack on a person's self. And as we learned in the previous section,
    personal identity and ideological permeability are deeply connected. The goal for any HERD engineer is to mold the core identity of the target audience to be completely benign to the propagated ideology.</p></b1>
    <b2 class="question" style = "left:70px; top:440px; width:700px;">6. Go to the "Ideologies" tab of the simulator and change audience core ideologies to be perpendicular to your propagated ideology. 
      <br><br>7. Run the same simulation as in #4 with the new settings. You should find an increase in the spread of the propagated ideology. Record your results in the table below.</b2>
