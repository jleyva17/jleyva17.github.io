    <b1 class="bodystyle1" style= "left:70px; top:125px; width:700px;">The Aisles Control Process (ACP), which was pioneered in the late 20th century is a combination of processes used to subconsciously manipulate 
    a population through the control of information flow. As Roger Aisles put it:
    <a href="https://theintercept.com/document/2018/10/30/a-plan-for-putting-the-gop-on-the-news/">people are lazy, they prefer the thinking be done for them.</a> The goal here is to allow people
    access only to information that has been pre-digested and filtered for them. Effectively making it impossible for people to form a complete opinion. The main challenge in using the ACP is in 
    knowing who your target is. Messaging must ALWAYS conform to the audience, not only in the form but in the content. 3c civilizations have a highly indivualistic populous, so they tend to place high value on
    individual freedoms and choice. This can easily be exploited to make people believe almost anything. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYAq9t9NmXM">For example if you convince them a position is in the name of their personal freedoms.</a></b1>
    <b2 class="question" style="left:70px; top:960px; width:700px;">1. Use the controls provided in the "TCT" tab of the simulator to broadcast the same message using different messaging techniques
    and record a graph of ideological shift vs time. Run the simulator for a decade. Make sure to use a wide variety of techniques for comparison.<br><br>2. Now restart the simulator and do the same thing, but instead of using a variety of
    messaging techniques, use the same messaging techniques but change the message. Record the changes on the same graph. </b2>
