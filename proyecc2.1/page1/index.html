    <p2 class="bodystyle1"; style= "left:60px; top:620px; width:810px; line-height:1.4;"> <p>The greatest advent of mankind will always be the civilization. Nearly all animals have figured out that they are 
      strongest in a group . So why aren't other animals as dominant as humanity? What set human civilization apart is how we leveraged our abilities to think critically and communicate complex ideas in order to solve
      mother nature's blights. Now that basic survival is no longer a problem that needs solving, the focus of the civilization has shifted. Ironically, too much critical thought and communication of complex ideas will 
      criple the production of the modern civilization . That is why HERD engineers (also known as HERDers) work so diligently to keep the level of critical thought in a society below a threshold. The value of that 
      threshold is also known as the Socrates ratio (&Phi;) of peak efficiency and it is dependent on a variety of factors. Whenever the level of critical thought is far above the Socrates ratio: there is a very high chance of 
      losing control of a civilization .</p><p>HERDers have developed a wide variety of <b>thougth control tools</b> (TCT's) throughout the centuries to sway thoughts on massive scales. At the base level, all TCT's function on the
      same principle. <b>To instill and exploit flawed ideologies on the target</b>. Since civilizations can have a wide variety of principles and tolerances, the effectiveness of individual TCTs can vary. A type 3c civilization provides 
      the most freedom for HERDers because TCT's have become engrained in every faucet of society and the populous is in apathetic equilibrium, minimizing resistance.</p><p>In this lab you will use a variety of 
      TCT's on a simulated type 3c society, collect any relevant data, and complete the questions .
